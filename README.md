#Multi-LanguageGreetingsApp

## Project description

***The Multi-Language Greetings App project is a simple application written in Python using the Flask framework. The app supports greetings in a variety of languages and was built to demonstrate Flask's core features and integration with GitHub Actions for task automation.***

## Project structure

***The project consists of the following files:***
```
- `hello_world.py`: File containing the `say_hello(name)` function with an example greeting.
- `say_hello.py`: Unit test file for the `say_hello` function.
- `multi_language.py`: The main file of the application, which contains the code that handles greetings in different languages. The application uses the Flask framework and a time delay (5 seconds) was added using `time.sleep(5)` before the application was launched.
```
